                                <li>Implemented an adversarial search algorithm to autonomously play the AI Wargame. This involved the integration of a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and the development of two unique heuristics (e1 and e2) to guide the AI's decision-making process. Ensured the AI operated efficiently across various modes including manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic, using a simple command-line interface for interactions.</li>
